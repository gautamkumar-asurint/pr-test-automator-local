"""Kotlin (Gradle + JUnit 5) test runner.

Stage 3 of the v0.2.0 rollout. Builds the ``./gradlew`` invocation and
parses Gradle's stdout — specifically the format produced by the
``com.adarshr.test-logger`` plugin that Asurint's accounts-service uses.

This parser was written against real Gradle output captured from
accounts-service for three scenarios: passing tests, failing tests, and
a Kotlin compile error. See ``tests/test_kotlin_runner.py`` for the exact
fixtures.

Output format reference (test-logger plugin enabled):

    Passing run:
        > Task :test
        unit.services.JwtAuthServiceTests
          Test some test name() PASSED
        SUCCESS: Executed 1 tests in 1.6s
        BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 6s

    Failing run:
        > Task :test FAILED
        unit.services.JwtAuthServiceTests
          Test some test name() FAILED
          ▼ Expect that "x":
            ✗ is equal to "y"
              at unit.services.X.test name(File.kt:30)
        FAILURE: Executed 1 tests in 1s (1 failed)
        BUILD FAILED in 5s

    Compile error:
        > Task :compileTestKotlin
        e: /path/File.kt: (13, 1): Expecting member declaration
        > Task :compileTestKotlin FAILED
        BUILD FAILED in 15s
        (Note: > Task :test does NOT appear)

Critical distinguishing signal: if ``> Task :test`` appeared, tests ran
(though some may have failed). If only ``:compileTestKotlin FAILED``
appeared, tests never ran — that's a compile error, not a test failure.

    Gradle's ``--tests`` flag accepts multiple values; we pass one per
    test file so each generated test gets its own class filter.

    ``--console=plain`` is critical: without it, the ``test-logger``
    plugin uses an interactive output mode with progress indicators and
    the structured format this module parses isn't produced. With it, we
    get the deterministic format shown in this module's docstring.

    even attempt a fix loop. We only want to bail when the error is
    something Claude CANNOT fix by rewriting test code — like missing
    Maven dependencies, daemon lock issues, or JVM startup failures.

    Compile errors (unresolved reference, type mismatch, wrong number
    of arguments, etc.) are deliberately NOT included here, because
    those are often fixable by rewriting the test. The fix loop should
    get a chance to try. If Claude can't fix it after max_fix_retries
    attempts, the run fails — that's better than silently giving up
    on a fixable problem.

    History: in v0.2.0a6.post3 and earlier, this returned compile
    errors too, which caused the bot to skip the fix loop on every
    compile error including ones Claude could easily fix (positional
    vs named argument mistakes, missing imports, etc.). Changed in
