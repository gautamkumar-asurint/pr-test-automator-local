"""Extract clean Kotlin source from LLM responses.

Claude Code's response to a "generate Kotlin tests" prompt can contain
any of these noise types alongside the actual code:

1. Markdown code fences: ```kotlin\n...\n```
2. Agent narration: "Now I have everything I need. Let me generate the tests."
3. Trailing commentary: "Notes on what each group covers: ..."
4. Section separators: ---
5. Tool-use narration: "The file write needs your approval..."

This module strips that noise and returns just the Kotlin code. Two
extractors:

- extract_kotlin_file for fresh-generation responses (full file:
  package + imports + class)
- extract_kotlin_tests_block for incremental responses (just
  @Test fun declarations, no class wrapper)

Both raise ExtractionError if they can't find Kotlin code in the
response — better to surface that loudly than to write prose to disk.

    3. If no fences at all, return the text as-is.

    v0.2.0 fix: previously this returned the FIRST fence unconditionally.
    Claude sometimes prefixes its response with a small explanatory
    fence (e.g., quoting the source function it's discussing) BEFORE
    the actual full-file fence. The old logic picked the explanatory
    fence and failed because it had no ``package`` declaration. The
