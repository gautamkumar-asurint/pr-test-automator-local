"""Plugin contract that every language handler must implement.

A LanguageHandler encapsulates everything that's language-specific:
- Which file extensions count as source code
- How to parse source to find changed functions/classes
- Where existing test files live
- How to run the language's test framework
- What prompts to send the LLM for test generation and fixing

The orchestrator and step files use this interface only — they never import
language-specific code directly. New languages plug in by implementing this
protocol and registering with the registry.

Stage 1 of the v0.2.0 refactor extracted the Python-specific logic out of
the step files into PythonLanguageHandler (see ``languages.python``). Stage
2 will add JavaLanguageHandler. The orchestrator's wiring doesn't change.
