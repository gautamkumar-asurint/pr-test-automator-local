    ``source_code`` is the full body of the function (or class). For a

    all 60 lines — useful for Claude to understand the function's
    purpose.

    ``diff_hunk`` is just the changed lines (the ``+``/``-`` lines from
    the diff) that fall within this function. Used by the test
    prompts to tell Claude what specifically changed, so generated
    tests focus on the changes rather than re-testing the whole
    function exhaustively.

    Defaults to empty string for backwards compatibility (Python
    handler doesn't populate it yet).
