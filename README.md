# pr-test-automator-local

Generate pytest tests for changed Python functions on your **local machine**, using **Claude Code** instead of the Anthropic API directly.

Same pipeline as the GitHub Actions version, but it runs from your terminal, reads `git diff` instead of a GitHub PR, and uses your Claude Code subscription instead of pay-per-API-call. After tests are generated and pass, it can optionally commit them, push the branch, and open a PR via `gh`.

## When to use this vs. the GitHub Action version

| | Local version | Action version |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | You run a command | PR opened/updated |
| LLM | Claude Code (subscription) | Anthropic API (pay per use) |
| Cost per run | $0 (covered by subscription) | ~$0.05-$0.20 |
| Enforcement | Voluntary — devs opt in | Automatic on every PR |
| Setup per project | Just install the CLI | Add a workflow file |
| Best for | Personal use, small teams already on Claude Code | Teams that want enforced coverage |

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+**
2. **git** (you almost certainly have this)
3. **Claude Code** — Anthropic's CLI. Install:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   Then run `claude` once and complete the sign-in flow. Verify with:
   ```bash
   claude --version
   ```
4. **gh CLI** *(only if you want auto-PR-opening)*. Install from https://cli.github.com/ and run `gh auth login`.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/pr-test-automator-local.git
cd pr-test-automator-local
pip install -e .
```

Verify:
```bash
pr-test-automator-local --help
```

## Quick start

In any Python project that has at least one committed change since `main`:

```bash
cd your-project/
pr-test-automator-local --base-branch main --source-root src
```

This:
1. Computes `git diff main...HEAD` and finds Python files changed
2. Parses each file with AST to find affected functions
3. Reads any existing test files for those sources
4. Asks Claude Code to generate or update tests
5. Runs pytest against the generated tests
6. If anything fails, asks Claude Code to fix it (once)
7. Prints a summary

Tests are written to the configured test dir but **not committed** by default. You inspect them, decide what to keep, edit if needed, then commit yourself.

## Generate, commit, push, and open a PR in one command

```bash
pr-test-automator-local \
  --base-branch main \
  --source-root src \
  --open-pr
```

`--open-pr` implies `--push` which implies `--commit-tests`. So:

1. Tests generated and run as above
2. Tests committed with author `pr-test-automator[bot]`
3. Commit pushed to your current branch's remote
4. PR opened via `gh pr create`

The commit message includes the pytest results, so reviewers see pass/fail counts and any failed test IDs without leaving the GitHub UI.

## CLI options

| Flag | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `--repo-path` | (auto-detect) | Path to your repo root |
| `--base-branch` | `main` | Branch to diff against |
| `--test-dirs` | `tests` | Comma-separated test dirs (priority order) |
| `--source-root` | (none) | Restrict analysis to files under this path |
| `--max-fix-retries` | `1` | How many times to ask Claude to fix failures |
| `--commit-tests` | off | Commit the generated tests |
| `--push` | off | Push the commit; implies `--commit-tests` |
| `--open-pr` | off | Open PR via `gh`; implies `--push` |
| `--claude-code-cmd` | `claude` | Override if your Claude Code binary is named differently |
| `--claude-code-timeout` | `180` | Seconds to wait for each Claude Code response |

## How it integrates with your editor

This tool runs in your terminal. It works alongside whatever editor you use because it operates on git state, not editor state. Suggested workflows:

**VS Code / Cursor**: open the integrated terminal (Ctrl+`), run the command. Tests appear in your project's test directory; VS Code's file watcher picks them up.

**JetBrains (IntelliJ / PyCharm)**: same — built-in terminal.

**Neovim/Vim**: run from your usual terminal, the editor picks up changes when you refocus.

**As a git hook (advanced)**: drop a wrapper into `.git/hooks/pre-push` that calls this tool. Tests get generated automatically before each push. Worth doing only after you've verified the tool's output style matches your team's expectations.

## What it does NOT do

- Modify your source code (only writes to test files)
- Send anything to Anthropic's API (Claude Code uses your subscription)
- Run if you have no uncommitted/committed changes since the base branch
- Enforce a coverage threshold (use `pytest-cov` with `--cov-fail-under` for that)
- Work for non-Python files (Python only — see the [pluggable-language section](#planned) below if you want Java/TS support)

## Cost

Per run: **$0** beyond your Claude Code subscription. Claude Code's pricing structure is per-user-per-month, not per-API-call, so even hundreds of runs/day cost the same.

By contrast, the GitHub Actions version costs ~$0.05-$0.20 per PR via the pay-per-token API.

## Limitations to know about

1. **One-shot Claude Code invocations.** This tool calls `claude --print` for each generation, which is a one-shot non-conversational mode. Claude Code's more powerful conversational features (multi-turn, file editing in place) aren't used here.

2. **No `tests/conftest.py` discovery.** Claude doesn't see your fixtures. If your existing tests rely heavily on conftest, Claude's generated tests may try to redefine fixtures inline. Worth checking and editing.

3. **The `covers()` heuristic is imperfect.** If you have a source function `bulk` and another `bulk_discount`, tests covering `bulk_discount` (e.g., `test_bulk_discount_zero`) might be wrongly matched to `bulk`. Pragmatic mitigation: name your functions distinctively.

4. **No class-based test support.** Free-floating `def test_*` only. If your team uses `class TestFoo:` style, the merge logic doesn't handle the class context cleanly.

5. **No Windows testing.** Should work in WSL or Git Bash, untested elsewhere.

## Troubleshooting

### `claude: command not found`
Claude Code isn't installed or isn't on PATH. Install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` and run `claude` once to authenticate.

### `Base branch 'main' not found`
The base branch needs to exist locally. Try:
```bash
git fetch origin main:main
```

### Tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mypackage'`
Your project needs to be pip-installed so generated tests can import your code:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### `gh pr create failed`
Either `gh` isn't installed, you're not authenticated (`gh auth login`), or a PR already exists for this branch (in which case the tool will reuse it on the next run).

### Tests are weird/wrong/duplicated
- Read them before committing — Claude has good days and bad days
- If existing tests get clobbered, file an issue with the test file content before/after

## Programmatic use

If you want to call this from your own Python code instead of via CLI:

```python
from pr_test_automator_local import LocalTestConfig, LocalTestPipeline

config = LocalTestConfig(
    repo_path="/path/to/your/repo",
    base_branch="main",
    source_root="src",
    commit_tests=True,
    push=True,
)
result = LocalTestPipeline(config).run()
print(result.is_passing, result.tests_generated)
```

## Swapping the LLM

The `llm_bridge.py` module exposes an `LLMBridge` protocol. The default is `ClaudeCodeBridge`, but you can implement any backend. For example, to use a local Ollama model:

```python
import subprocess

class OllamaBridge:
    def generate(self, system_prompt: str, user_prompt: str) -> str:
        combined = f"{system_prompt}\n\n{user_prompt}"
        proc = subprocess.run(
            ["ollama", "run", "qwen2.5-coder:7b", combined],
            capture_output=True, text=True, check=True,
        )
        return proc.stdout

pipeline = LocalTestPipeline(config, llm=OllamaBridge())
```

Quality drops with smaller models, but cost goes to literally zero.
